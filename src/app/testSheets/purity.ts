      'One of the key concepts that makes React, React is purity. A pure component or hook is one that is:\n\nIdempotent – You always get the same result every time you run it with the same inputs – props, state, context for component inputs; and arguments for hook inputs.\n\nHas no side effects in render – Code with side effects should run separately from rendering. For example as an event handler – where the user interacts with the UI and causes it to update; or as an Effect – which runs after render.\n\nDoes not mutate non-local values: Components and Hooks should never modify values that aren’t created locally in render.',

It does not change any objects or variables that existed before it was called.\nSame inputs, same output. Given the same inputs, a pure function should always return the same result.',

    title: 'Functional Programming',
    initialContent:
      'Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. This approach leads to cleaner, more predictable code and easier for testing, and a more declarative style of programming.\n\nIn contrast to the imperative programming paradigm, which emphasizes changes in state. Key principles of functional programming include:\n\n- Immutability: Data cannot be changed once created. Instead, new data structures are returned with the necessary changes.\n- Pure Functions: Always return the same result given the same inputs and have no side effects.\n- First-Class and Higher-Order Functions: Treating functions as values that can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.\n- Composition: Building complex functions by combining simpler ones, promoting reusability and modularity.\n- Declarative Rather Than Imperative: Describing what the program should accomplish rather than detailing the steps to achieve it.',
